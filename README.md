## 1.Bussiness Understanding

In this project, we are  going to analyze a dataset about the westbound traffic on the [I-94 Interstate highway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_94). 

The aim of our investigation is to identify a few indicators of heavy traffic on I-94. These indicators can include weather, time of day, weekday, and so on. For example, we may discover that traffic is typically heavier in the summer or when it snows.
